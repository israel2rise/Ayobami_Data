**Project Summary**


An HR attrition dashboard is a visual representation of key metrics related to employee turnover within an organization. The dashboard includes various components to provide a comprehensive view of attrition trends.
Here's a summary of the main elements:

Attrition Employee Count:

Displays the total number of employees who have left the organization during a specific time period.
Active Employee Count:

Shows the total number of employees currently working in the organization.
Attrition Rate by Gender:

Breaks down the attrition rate based on gender, providing insights into whether there are gender-specific trends in employee turnover.
Attrition Rate by Education:

Analyzes the attrition rate based on employees' educational qualifications, helping identify any correlation between education levels and turnover.
Attrition Rate by Age Bin Size:

Categorizes employees into age groups (bins) and calculates the attrition rate for each group. This helps identify if certain age demographics are more prone to leaving the organization.

By visualizing these metrics on a dashboard, HR professionals and organizational leaders can quickly grasp the overall attrition trends, identify patterns, and make informed decisions to address retention challenges. The dashboard serves as a valuable tool for strategic workforce planning and implementing targeted interventions to reduce attrition.
